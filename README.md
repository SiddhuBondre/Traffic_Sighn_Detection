# ðŸš¦ Traffic Sign Detection

# ðŸ“Œ Overview

Traffic Sign Detection is a computer vision project aimed at automatically detecting and classifying traffic signs from images or videos. This project leverages Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to recognize traffic signs accurately, which can be used in autonomous vehicles, driver assistance systems, and smart traffic monitoring.
